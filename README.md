MODERN CONTROL SYSTEMS

Modern Control Systems, or advanced control systems, and more precisely dynamic systems, is one of the core courses in the control focus of the electrical engineering undergraduate program. The topics covered in this course form the foundation of control theory, and are directly or indirectly applicable to a wide range of research areas related to control theory, artificial intelligence, and robotics.

It introduces the fundamental concepts of dynamic systems and necessary skills for analyzing, designing, and controlling such systems.

Topics: 
1)Review of Linear Algebra
2)State-Space Representation
3)Controllability and Observability
4)Observer Design
5)Stability Analysis
6) etc.
